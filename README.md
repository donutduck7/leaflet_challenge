Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet
This project utilizes Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps, to visualize earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The visualization displays earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths on an interactive map, allowing users to explore recent seismic activity around the world.

Getting Started
To run the earthquake visualization:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Alternatively, you can access the live version of the visualization here (insert link to live demo if available).

Features
Interactive Map: Utilizes Leaflet to create an interactive map interface.
Circle Markers: Represents earthquake locations as circle markers on the map.
Marker Size: Bigger earthquakes appear with larger circle markers based on their magnitude.
Marker Color: The color of each marker indicates the depth of the earthquake.
Popup Information: Clicking on a marker displays additional information about the earthquake, including its magnitude and depth.
Legend: Provides a legend on the map explaining the color-coded depth ranges.
Scale Control: Displays a scale bar on the map to indicate distance.
Zoom Control: Adds zoom buttons for easy navigation on the map interface.
Data Source
The earthquake data is sourced from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. The GeoJSON feed used in this visualization is updated regularly to provide up-to-date information about seismic events worldwide.
